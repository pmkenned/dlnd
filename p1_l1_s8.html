	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	<p>We've designed this program such that you only require the following prerequisite knowledge:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Required: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036">Intermediate Python experience</a>.</li>
		<li>Optional: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus">Multivariable Calculus</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</a> if possible.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That being said, we've included a lot of the detailed mathematics for those of you who do want to go in depth and understand the theory behind these concepts. Such content is optional and shouldn't prevent you from doing the projects. However, it is encouraged for a theoretical understanding.</p>
