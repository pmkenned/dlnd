	<h2>DeepTraffic</h2>

	<p>Another great application of deep learning is in simulating traffic and making driving decisions. You can find the DeepTraffic simulator <a href="https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/">here</a>. The network here is attempting to learn a driving strategy such that the car is moving as fast as possible using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>. The network is rewarded when the car chooses actions that result in it moving fast. It's this feedback that allows the network to find a strategy of actions for optimal speed.</p>

	<p>To learn more about setting the parameters and training the network, read the <a href="https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/">overview here</a>.</p>

	<p>Discuss how you built your network and your results with your fellow students in the #deeptraffic channel on Slack.</p>
