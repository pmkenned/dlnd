	<h1>Books to read</h1>

	<p>We believe that you learn best when you are exposed to multiple perspectives on the same idea. As such, we recommend checking out a few of the books below to get an added perspective on Deep Learning.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning">Grokking Deep Learning</a> by Andrew Trask. Use our exclusive discount code <strong>traskud17</strong> for 40% off. This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.</li>
		<li><a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks And Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen. This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">The Deep Learning Textbook</a> from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This online book contains a lot of material and is the most rigorous of the three books suggested.</li>
	</ul>
