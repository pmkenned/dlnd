	<h1>Community Guidelines</h1>

	<p>Your experience in the Nanodegree program and community should be an engaging, fulfilling, and positive one. As such, we have outlined the following system for reporting behavior that does not live up to Udacityâ€™s standards, so it can quickly be addressed by our staff.</p>

	<p>All reports of suspected violations to the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/legal/terms-of-service">TOU</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Code of Conduct</a> or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/legal/community-guidelines">Honor Code</a> should be submitted to report@udacity.com and will be reviewed. If you witness or are experiencing any violations of our policies please get in touch with us. Below prohibited actions as set forth on our <a href="https://www.udacity.com/legal/community-guidelines">Community Code of Conduct</a>:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Harassment:</strong> Inappropriate, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent comments or conduct.</li>
		<li><strong>Discrimination:</strong> Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability or disease</li>

	</ul>
