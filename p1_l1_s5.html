	<h1>Deadline Policy</h1>

	<p>The program is project-based, and each project has a deadline. It is strongly recommended that you complete each project on time, in order to ensure you meet graduation requirements.</p>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>

	<p><strong>What happens if I don’t complete a project on time?</strong><br />
	It is strongly recommended that you complete each project on time to ensure you meet graduation requirements. To graduate, you must complete, submit, and meet expectations for all required projects within four months of your start date. While there is no penalty for missing a project deadline, missing one puts you at risk to be removed from the program if you do not stay on track and complete all required projects before the term ends. Finally, by keeping pace with your fellow students, you'll gain much more value from forums and Slack channels!</p>

	<p><strong>What are my options if I don’t complete the program within four months?</strong><br />
	If you do not complete the term by the term deadline, you will receive one free four-week extension, which will be automatically applied to your account. If you do not complete the term within the extension period, you will be removed from the program and will no longer be able to access course content. To resume access to the course, you would need to re-enroll in a new term and pay the associated enrollment fees again. Your progress will carry over to the new term, so you will be able to continue. You are also welcome to apply to either the Artificial Intelligence, Robotics Software Engineer, or Self-Driving Car Nanodegree programs, but your admission is not guaranteed. This is a benefit reserved only for graduates of this program.</p>
